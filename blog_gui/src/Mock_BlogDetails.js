        title: "Caching in Python Using the LRU Cache Strategy",
        card_body: "There are many ways to achieve fast and responsive applications. Caching is one approach that, when used correctly, makes things much faster while decreasing the load on computing resources. Python’s functools module comes with the @lru_cache decorator, which gives you the ability to cache the result of your functions using the Least Recently Used (LRU) strategy. This is a simple yet powerful technique that you can use to leverage the power of caching in your code.",
